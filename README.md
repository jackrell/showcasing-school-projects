# School Projects Repository

This repository contains a select set of my favorite programming projects I have completed while at Notre Dame.

They largely draw from two classes:
## Fundamentals of Computing
- Conway's Game of Life (C)
- Crossword Generator (C)
- gx, a custom GUI shooter game (C & X11 graphics)

## Systems Programming
- Folders Containing C recreations of various command line utilities.
- Miles, a Python web crawler and media scraper


Special thanks to professors Peter Bui and Ramzi Bualuan.
